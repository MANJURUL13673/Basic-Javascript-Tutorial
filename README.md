# Basic-Javascript-Tutorial
## Introduction
This repository will discuss the basic Javascript operation from Scratch to Advance
## Tools that we need
- Node JS
- Code Editor - Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode etc.
- Browser - Chrome
## Environment Setup
- Download and install node js - https://nodejs.org/en/<br>
    Open your command line and write -
    ```
    node -v
    ```
    If node js successfully installed, you will get the node js version number.
- Code Editor - It is totally your choice. Nothing is bad. But I am now currently use VSCode.
- Browser - Chrome is preferable.
## Start with the first code
Create a file name HelloWorld.js. You can give any name with extension .js.
Write some code in the file.
```
console.log("Hello World!!!")
```
Open your command line. Go to the directory where the file exist. Run the file by writting the command - 
```
node HelloWorld.js
```
In the command line after write `node`, give a space and write your file name whatever it is. Press Enter. 
<br>You will see the output `Hello World!!!`
<br><b>File: HelloWorld.js</b>
## Introduction to variable
We can declare variable by calling `let` or `const` in JS. Both can store and understand any type of data like int, float, string etc.
- let - this type of variable can vary. We can reinitialize it.
- const - this type of variable is constant. It can not reinitialize.
<p>For declarying string <code>''</code> and <code>""</code> both are acceptable.
No need to worry about <code>;</code> in the last of line. JS gives flexibility to use this.<br>

## Introduction to number
Mathermatical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be done in JS.<br>
% sign calculate the modulus of a number.<br>
<b>Special Tricks:</b>
- Bracket a segment by selecting the segment and press Shift + 9.
- For commenting several lines, select these lines and press Ctrl + /.<br>
